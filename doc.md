MRCS-4-Station-Tel-Control panel.  

Developed for Chris Czyzewski, 4 of the stations and the DS need to be able to signal 4 stations.  Each has a "Start" push button and a LED to indicate
"Call Pending."  An optional second set of LEDs will show station status (off hook) but Chris isn't using it.  This board will work with a dedicated
distribution board to power them and allow routing of signals among the stations.
